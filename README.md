# Simple Budget

This simple budgeting tool is designed to facilitate efficient and organized budget management and visualization. It provides a clear view of the total budget amount, remaining balance, and accumulated expenses to date. The application allows users to assign values to different departments and adjust these values as needed. There is an option to quickly increase a department's value with a preconfigured button that adds 10 units, or users can manually enter a specific amount. Additionally, users can completely remove the assigned value from any department with a single click. This tool is ideal for professionals and organizations seeking detailed and precise control over their budget.
